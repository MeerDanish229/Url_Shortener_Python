I'm thrilled to share that I'm currently learning Python and working on my internship project at Codexcue. One of my latest tasks was to create a basic URL shortener using Python and Tkinter.

It's a simple yet functional application that allows users to shorten URLs and copy them to the clipboard with ease. Here's a quick preview of the project:

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The backend logic for handling url Shortener.
- **Tkinter**: The GUI library used to create the url shortener's user interface.
